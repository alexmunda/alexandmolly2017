            h4 Molly
          .about-us-text
            p Thinking back about how I met Molly, I am truly amazed at how we got to where we are today. Who knew that two high school kids that couldn’t even drive yet would end up getting married 10 years later. A lot has changed over the 10 years since I met Molly: we broke up after I graduated high school so I could be a ‘cool college kid’ (turns out that was a terrible idea), we started talking again because of a misunderstanding by one of her friends 3 years later (thank you whoever you are), we somehow managed to survive a long distance relationship for 2 years (never again), and we bought a dog (love you Moose). I can tell you one thing though, I would not be the person I am today if I did not have her in my life.
          .about-us-text
            p When she’s not kicking butt in nursing school or saving lives as a nurse intern, Molly spends her time being an all around amazing woman. She’s a fantastic chef and her baking is incredible. I couldn’t ask for a better Euchre partner though I’m surprised she's kept me around this long after the number of times I’ve trumped her ace. She told me that we needed a dog and I thought she was crazy, that turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made (second to asking Molly to marry me of course). She’s also the most thoughtful and caring person I know, one time she surprised me with coffee and beer just because I did well in a job interview. You can’t not marry someone after they surprise you with two of the best things on the planet.
          .about-us-text
            p Did I mention that Molly makes me a better person? Who knows where I would be today had we not gone on our second first date. Oh yeah, I know, I wouldn’t be madly in love with the woman of my dreams that I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with. I also wouldn’t know that apples, cinnamon, and applesauce are three of the best things you can combine in your morning oatmeal. Oatmeal I could probably live without, Molly I could not. I love her more than I can express in words, and I always will.

            h4 Alex
          .about-us-text
            p I have to be honest when putting this website together I saved this section for last because I wasn’t quite sure on how to give Alex justice. I could provide a laundry list of attributes to describe him but the list might be endless. I would say there a few things that stick out to me on why I love Alex so much. First, he is a huge family man. Doesn’t matter if it is my family or his he loves to spend time with them. He is often the one asking if we are having family dinner on Sunday and what to bring. I love that Alex is so connected with both of our families and willing to stop what he is doing to help any of us out.
          .about-us-text.margin-top-30
            p Secondly, Alex might be the most selfless person I know. I do not think in the ten years I have known him he has made a decision solely based on his wants. He is constantly checking in and seeing how he can help take a burden off of me. He gets up early each morning to take care of Moose and is always willing to help clean or cook. His actions help teach me each day to be a little less selfish. Alex has provided me with countless amounts of laughter and great memories. I do not know anyone with a better sense of humor or willing to laugh at himself. Without Alex I would not have nearly as much joy and humor in my life. He has taught me how to not take the world so seriously.
          .about-us-text.margin-top-30
            p Without Alex, I would be lost on how to make the perfect cup of coffee nor be the person I am today. My favorite characteristic about Alex is his ability to make me a better person. He is constantly pushing me to achieve greatness or do the best I can. He is patient and kind but not afraid to encourage me to be or to do better. He is an amazing partner that can often finish my sentences and says exactly what I am thinking. He has an incredible work ethic that is apparent in all that he does.

          .about-us-text
            p Mary Catherine or MC as she is lovingly nicknamed in our home is my younger sister but I look up to her for so many reasons; she is honest, intelligent, and hilarious. Truthfully, I don’t have many memories in my life without her.  One of my earliest childhood memories is taking her home from the hospital on a hot August day. My dad took my brothers to go get the car and I was instructed to wait patiently with my mom for them to come pick us up. Instead of waiting patiently I ran around the waiting area singing I am a big sister on repeat.  As you can imagine my mom was livid with me. MC and I became fast friends and did just about everything together.

          .about-us-text
            p Kalan and I met while we were studying at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln. She is one of the most compassionate and loving people I know. She is widely creative and decorated our house on Surfside perfectly.  Kalan and I spent way too much time and money exploring local coffee shops and listening to John Mayer while in Lincoln. Kalan, I could not think of a better friend to support Al Pal and I on such a special day, your joy for life is contagious and I think everyone in the world would be better off if they had a Kalan by their side.  Thanks for your continued friendship and moving to KC (wishful thinking?).

            p Dani and I met for the first time many years ago when my brother Jonathan brought her home. Instantly, Dani and I hit it off and could talk for hours on end. She has been such a great role model in my life and really fits into the family. She has such an infectious laugh and is an even better mom. Dani, thank you for helping me through wedding planning your expertise has been invaluable. You are such a great person and I am so thankful that Jon married up.

          .about-us-text
            p Elyssa is Alex’s sister that I have had the joy of spending many hours with. She is such a positive, hard-working person that is full of charisma. I have many great memories with Elyssa but I love nights that we sit around and play Euchre or enjoying a bottle of wine.  She is always willing to help out and is such a positive influence on those around her. Elyssa, I am so blessed to be gaining another sister especially one as accepting as you. Thanks for your constant laughter and support throughout this wedding process.

She has a great sense of humor and the best laugh. Celie, thanks for taking part in such a big day for Alex and I. We love you and can’t wait to have you as our flower girl.

          .about-us-text.margin-top-289
            p Josh is Alex's younger brother. They almost shared a birthday, but 8 year old Alex told his mom that he didn't want to share a birthday, so she waited until the next day to have Josh. Josh doesn't say much, but when he does, it's comedic gold. Josh likes video games as much as every other teenage boy does, and he's reached the point where he beats Alex in every game they play together (except Super Smash Bros). We are all looking forward to Josh's best man speech, but I don't think he is. From helping Alex move into his apartment, to watching the Moose when Alex and Molly cannot, Josh is an all around great guy and a fantastic brother.
